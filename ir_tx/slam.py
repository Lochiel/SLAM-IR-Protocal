#DONE Reduce data and address size from 8 to 4 bits
#DONE Reduce burst length 
#DONE Reduce long/short space ratio
#DONE Make burst time based on tx frequency, so that higher frequencies reduce tx time
#DONE Reduce Start block size 
# First and second burst are both one DASH in length. A properly coded transmission will not have any other sequential DASH'es
